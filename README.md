# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Coffey

I'm a senior frontend engineer focused on building accessible, scalable UIs with React and modern web tech.

🛠 Most of my recent work is at [Department of Veterans Affairs GitHub](https://github.com/patrick-va), where I’ve been an active contributor to the Veteran Enrollment Services (VES) project since 2024.

📁 You can also find some legacy projects and experiments here on my personal GitHub.
